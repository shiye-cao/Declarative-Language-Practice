    decision: {decision:"Not admitted", cot:"Okay, let's take a look at this student's profile again. They have a GPA of 3.77 from a top-ranked undergraduate school, which is pretty solid. Their GRE Writing score is 5 out of 6, which is excellent. The Statements of Purpose and Diversity are both rated 4.5 out of 5, so those are strong points.\nBut wait, the GRE Verbal is 139 and Quant is 148. For Engineering programs, Quant is really important. The average GRE Quant for top engineering schools is usually around 160-165, so 148 is way below that. Even Verbal might be a bit low, though maybe less critical for engineering. Then there's the recommendation letters averaging 0.33 out of 2. That's really low. Strong letters are crucial because they vouch for the student's abilities and potential. A 0.33 suggests lukewarm or weak recommendations, which is a big red flag.\nThe undergrad school is top-ranked, which helps, but the low GRE scores and weak recommendations might overshadow that. Even with strong essays, if the numbers and recommendations aren't there, the committee might pass. Some schools might overlook GRE if other areas are stellar."}

    decision: {decision:"Admitted", cot:"Alright, let me try to figure out whether this student is likely to get admitted to a graduate program. The user wants me to consider academic performance, research experience, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, and other relevant factors.\nFirst, let's look at the GRE scores. The verbal score is 155, which is decent, and the quant score is 169, which is really high. Since the student's undergrad major is Business, a high quant score could be important, especially if they're applying to a program that values quantitative skills. The writing score is 3.5, which is average. Not too bad, but not outstanding either.\nNext, the GPA is 3.64 from a top-ranked undergraduate school. That's solid, but maybe not exceptional. However, coming from a top-ranked school might add some weight to the GPA. The major is Business, so if they're applying to a business-related grad program, that's directly relevant.\nThe statement of purpose strength is 3 out of 5. That's a bit of a red flag. A strong SOP is crucial because it shows the applicant's goals, motivations, and fit for the program. A score of 3 might indicate it's generic or lacks clarity. The diversity statement is 2.5 out of 5, which is also on the lower side. If the program values diversity and inclusion, a low score here might hurt their chances.\nThe recommendation letters have a strength of 1.67 out of 2. That's actually pretty good. Strong letters can really bolster an application, especially if they come from reputable professors or professionals in the field. Since the undergrad school is top-ranked, the recommenders might be well-known, which adds credibility.\nNow, considering research experience: there's no mention of it in the profile. If the program is research-focused, lacking research experience could be a downside. However, for some professional or course-based master's programs, research experience might be less critical.\nThe undergraduate school ranking is 1, which is top-tier. That's a big plus. Admissions committees often take the reputation of the undergraduate institution into account. A 3.64 GPA from a top school might be viewed more favorably than a higher GPA from a less prestigious school.\nPutting it all together: the high quant GRE score is a strong point, especially for a Business major possibly moving into a quantitative field. The GPA and school ranking are solid. The recommendation letters are strong. However, the SOP and diversity statement are weaker, and there's no mention of research experience. If the program values quantitative skills and has a focus on professional rather than academic preparation, the student might still have a good shot. But if the program is highly competitive and looks for standout SOPs and diversity contributions, those lower scores could be a problem.\nAlso, the GRE Writing score of 3.5 might be a minor concern, but for a Business program, writing might not be as critical as in, say, Humanities. However, some programs do value communication skills.\nI need to weigh these factors. The strong quant score, good GPA from a top school, and strong recommendations are significant positives. The weaker SOP and diversity statement are negatives but might not outweigh the strengths if the program prioritizes academic credentials and quant skills. However, if the program is very competitive and holistic in their review, the weaker parts could tip the balance. Without research experience, if the program expects it, that's another negative. But if it's a professional program, maybe not. Overall, I'm leaning towards admitted, but it's a close call. Wait, the SOP is 3/5 which is moderate. Maybe the rest of the application compensates."}

    decision: {decision:"Not admitted", cot:"Okay, so I need to figure out if this student is likely to get admitted to a graduate program based on their profile. Let's break down each attribute one by one.\nFirst, the GRE scores: Verbal is 152, Quant is 168, and Writing is 1.5. The Quant score is really high, 168 out of 170, which is impressive. But the Verbal is 152, which is around the 50th percentile, so maybe average. The Writing score is really low, 1.5 out of 6. That seems concerning because writing is important for grad school, especially in Humanities. Wait, their undergrad major is Humanities, so maybe the Writing score is more important here? But 1.5 is way below average. That could be a red flag.\nNext, GPA is 4.0. Perfect GPA, that's excellent. But their undergrad school ranking is 2, which is medium. A 4.0 from a medium-ranked school might still be good, but maybe not as prestigious as a top-ranked school. But a 4.0 is a 4.0, right? That shows consistent performance.\nUndergraduate major is Humanities. The grad program they're applying to isn't specified, but since their major is Humanities, maybe they're applying to a related field. If so, their Verbal and Writing scores might be more critical. But their Verbal is okay, Writing is very low. However, Quant is super high. If the program is something quantitative, maybe that's a plus, but Humanities usually aren't. Maybe they're switching fields? But their SOP and other aspects would need to explain that.\nStatement of Purpose Strength is 4.5 out of 5, which is strong. Diversity Statement is 3 out of 5, so average. But the recommendation letters are 0 out of 2, which is really bad. Recommendations are crucial because they speak to the student's abilities and potential. If all letters are weak, that's a major issue. Even with a strong SOP and GPA, weak recommendations can sink an application.\nPutting it all together: High GPA, high Quant, low Verbal and Writing, strong SOP, average Diversity Statement, terrible recommendations. Since the major is Humanities, the low Writing score and maybe Verbal could be problematic. Also, recommendations being 0 is a huge red flag. Admissions committees rely heavily on recommendation letters to gauge a student's readiness and fit. Even with a perfect GPA and strong SOP, weak letters might indicate that the professors don't support the student's application, which could lead to rejection. The Quant score is excellent, but in Humanities, that might not be as relevant. The Writing score being so low could indicate poor communication skills, which are vital in Humanities. The medium-ranked undergrad school might not be a big issue with a 4.0 GPA."}

    decision: {decision:"Admitted", cot:"Okay, let's tackle this one. The student has some mixed attributes here. First, looking at the GRE scores: Verbal is 154, Quant is a perfect 170, and Writing is 5. The Quant score is outstanding, especially for a Natural Science major. A perfect score here is a big plus. The Verbal is decent, and Writing is strong.\nGPA is 3.02 from a top-ranked undergrad school. Hmm, a 3.02 is on the lower side, especially for a top school. But maybe the program weighs GRE more heavily? Some grad programs might overlook a lower GPA if other areas are strong, especially if the major is rigorous. Natural science can be tough, so maybe the GPA isn't as bad as it looks. But still, 3.02 is below average for competitive programs.\nUndergraduate major is Natural Science, which aligns with graduate programs in that field. The school ranking is top, which adds prestige. Statement of Purpose is 1.5/5, which is weak. That's a problem because SOP is crucial for explaining the student's goals and fit. Diversity statement is 2.5/5, which is just okay. But recommendation letters are 1.67/2, which is pretty strong. So strong letters but weak SOP and average diversity statement.\nResearch experience isn't mentioned here. If the student has relevant research, that could help, but since it's not listed, maybe that's a gap. For Natural Science, research experience is often important.\nThe big strengths are the perfect GRE Quant and strong recommendations. Weaknesses are low GPA, weak SOP, and average diversity statement. The top undergrad school might help offset the GPA a bit. But the SOP being weak is a red flag. Admissions committees look for a clear, compelling narrative. If the SOP is weak, they might question the applicant's commitment or clarity of purpose.\nAlso, the GRE Writing score is 5, which is good, but in Natural Science, writing might be less emphasized than in Humanities. Still, technical writing matters. The Verbal score is okay but not stellar.\nSo, balancing all these: exceptional Quant GRE, strong recommendations, top school, but low GPA and weak SOP. The lack of research experience (assuming none) could be a downside. If the program is Quant-heavy and values test scores, maybe they'll overlook the GPA and SOP. But many top programs want a holistic view."}

    decision: {decision:"Not admitted", cot:"Okay, let's take a look at this student's profile. First, their GRE scores: Verbal is 159, which is pretty solid. Quant is 168, which is really high, especially for a Social Science major. But the GRE Writing score is 2.5 out of 6, which seems low. The GPA is a perfect 4.0, which is impressive, even though the undergraduate school is ranked medium (2). Their major is Social Science, so the high Quant score might not be as critical here compared to, say, Engineering.\nThe Statement of Purpose is average (3/5), and the Diversity Statement is a bit above average (3.5/5). The recommendation letters are at 0.67 out of 2, which is quite weak. Letters of recommendation are usually important because they provide insight into the student's abilities and potential from faculty who have worked with them. Weak letters could raise red flags.\nGiven that this is a Social Science program, writing skills are probably important. The low GRE Writing score might be a concern, especially paired with an average SOP. However, the GPA is perfect, which shows consistent academic performance. The high Quant score might not be as relevant here, but it's still a strong point. The medium-ranked school isn't a deal-breaker, especially with a 4.0 GPA. The weak recommendations are a significant drawback, though. Admissions committees might question why the endorsements aren't stronger if the student is otherwise qualified.\nAlso, the SOP and Diversity Statement aren't standout, which means the application might not have a strong narrative or clear research goals. Without strong letters or compelling essays, even a high GPA and good GRE scores might not be enough. However, the perfect GPA from a medium-ranked school could indicate the student is very capable and hardworking. Maybe the program values GPA and GRE scores more than other factors? But typically, holistic reviews consider all aspects."}

    decision: {decision:"Not admitted", cot:"Okay, let's tackle this student profile. The applicant is applying to a graduate program in Humanities. Let's break down each attribute one by one.\nFirst, the GRE scores: Verbal is 152, Quant is a perfect 170, and Writing is 1.5. For a Humanities program, Verbal and Writing are usually more critical than Quant. A 152 in Verbal might be on the lower side depending on the program's average. But the Quant score being perfect is impressive, though maybe not as relevant for Humanities. The Writing score of 1.5 is really low, which could be a red flag since writing is essential in Humanities.\nGPA is 3.73 from a top-ranked undergrad school. That's solid, especially coming from a prestigious institution. The major is Humanities, which aligns with the grad program, so that's a plus.\nStatement of Purpose is 4.5 out of 5, which is strong. A well-written SOP can really help, especially explaining any weaknesses. Diversity Statement is 3.5, which is decent but not outstanding.\nRecommendation letters are 1.67 out of 2. That's pretty strong, indicating good faculty support. However, the Writing score is a big concern. Even with strong recommendations and SOP, such a low Writing score might be a deal-breaker for a Humanities program where writing is crucial. They might question the applicant's ability to handle graduate-level writing tasks.\nSo, even though the Quant is perfect and GPA is good, the low Writing score and average Verbal might overshadow those strengths. The strong SOP and recommendations help, but the Writing score is a significant weakness. Also, the top undergrad ranking adds some credibility. But in Humanities, writing is key. Without a waiver or explanation for the low Writing score, the committee might hesitate. Maybe if the SOP addresses the Writing score issue, but there's no mention of that here. Overall, it's a tough call."}

    decision: {decision:"Admitted", cot:"Okay, let's tackle this. The student is applying to a graduate program, so I need to evaluate their profile based on the given attributes. First, I'll go through each component step by step.\nStarting with the GRE scores. The Verbal is 156, which is a decent score. Quant is 169, which is almost perfect—definitely a strong point. Writing is 5 out of 6, which is pretty good too. For a Business major, Quant is super important, so that 169 is a big plus.\nNext, the GPA is 3.74 from a top-ranked undergrad school. That's solid, not perfect, but still strong. Coming from a top school adds credibility. Their major is Business, which aligns with the graduate program they're applying to, so that's a good fit.\nThe Statement of Purpose is rated 5 out of 5, which is excellent. A strong SOP can really make a difference, especially if it clearly outlines their goals and fit for the program. The Diversity Statement is 3.5 out of 5, which is average to good. Not the highest, but not a red flag either.\nRecommendation letters are 1.67 out of 2. That's a strong score. It suggests the recommenders think highly of the student, which is important because strong letters can vouch for their abilities and potential.\nNow, considering the program they're applying to—Business. Quantitative skills are crucial here, so the near-perfect GRE Quant score is a major asset. The GPA and undergrad school ranking support their academic capability. The SOP being perfect means they've likely articulated their reasons for pursuing the program well, which is a big plus. The recommendation letters add further support.\nPotential weaknesses? The GRE Verbal is 156, which is good but maybe not stellar. However, for a Business program, Verbal might be less critical than Quant. The Diversity Statement is okay but not outstanding. However, given that the SOP is strong, that might compensate.\nAlso, there's no mention of research experience, which might be a consideration. But if this is a professional or course-based program rather than a research-focused one, that might not be as important. The focus here seems to be on academic performance and quantitative skills, which the student excels in.\nPutting it all together, the student has strong academic credentials, a top Quant score, excellent SOP, and solid recommendations. The minor weaknesses in Verbal and Diversity Statement are likely outweighed by the strengths. Especially since Business programs prioritize Quant, GPA, and SOP."}
